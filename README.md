Technical Take-Home Assessment
==============================

Included is a functioning web application. Your task is to compile and deploy it using containers.

The source code intentionally has many many flaws.
Feel free to IMPROVE ANYTHING you can possibly think of: the application itself, code style, fix bugs, visual style, the deployment process, tests, security, etc.

Total completion of the exercise is not necessarily required.
First focus on the areas of this task where you can provide most value (show off your skills).
If time permits complete the other portions as best you can, or document what you might do or need to learn to complete them.

For example:
- If infrastructure is your thing, setup the servers before you start modifying the source code of the app.
- If you like writing Go or backend code, show us what you can do in the Go app before moving on.
- If you're really into JavaScript or CSS, make the frontend as awesome as you can.
- If you strong at design maybe submit some improved screen mocks.

Create a local git repo and commit all changes as you progress.
Add any new source files or documentation files to the repo too.
Use your commit messages as a way to take notes on your approach, things you did (and why), and anything you learned along the way.


Tasks
=====

- Compile the included Go webserver application.
  - If you choose to use the unmodified code, you will need to retrieve and paste a Github API key and username into the source before compiling.
- Package everything into a container image.
- Deploy the container to a running CoreOS Linux server.
- Provide us with a URL to reach the web application.
- Automate the entire process above the best you can in the time allotted.
- Improve the source code for any part of the app as you see fit (see previous section)
- Tar an gzip the git repo you created and email it to us (please do not push it to any public online repo, aka Github) (and don't send us any API keys or passwords)
